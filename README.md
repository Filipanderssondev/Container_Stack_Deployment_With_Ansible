## 1. Introduction<br>
**Greetings!**
_...and welcome to our project. This project is a the first project <a href="https://github.com/rafaelurrutiasilva/Proxmox_on_Nuc/blob/main/Extra/Mermaid/Projects.md">in a series of projects</a> with the end goal of setting up a complete virtualized, automated, and monitored IT-Enviroment as a part of our internship on [The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI)](https://www.smhi.se/en/about-smhi) IT-department at the headquarters in Norrköping. The second goal of these projects are also supposed to serve as a set-up guide here on Github for anyone and everyone that wants to follow along! we will link every project to each other aswell._<br>

## 2. Goals and Objectives
This is part of a larger ongoing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) that will use Proxmox as a base. 
The goal of this project is to build a complete IT-environment and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying components and their part in a larger production chain.
<br>
<br>

## Method

### - Preparation
- We have our earlier projects as a foundation, [a Server running Proxmox](https://github.com/rafaelurrutiasilva/Proxmox_on_Nuc/tree/) and proxmox running [three replicated virtual machines from a Rocky Linux OS base](https://github.com/Filipanderssondev/Rocky_Linux_OS_Base_for_VMs) and [Ansible configuration on the management vm](https://github.com/JonatanHogild/Ansible_on_management_vm)
- We did our own separate processes at first, practicing on our local laptops with ansible an Podman for example

## 4. Target Audience
- This repo is for anyone who wants a step-by-step guide on .
This repo is also part of a larger project aimed at people interested in learning about IaC, and building such an environment from scratch.

> [!NOTE]  
> My work here is not finished yet. I need, among other things, to supplement with instructions on how each component should be configured to work together as well supplement with an overview image that explains how the whole thing works.
