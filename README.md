## 1. Introduction<br>
**Welcome friend!**
_...to our fourth project <a href="https://github.com/rafaelurrutiasilva/Proxmox_on_Nuc/blob/main/Extra/Mermaid/Projects.md">in a series of projects</a> with the end goal of setting up a complete virtualized, automated, and monitored IT-Enviroment as a part of our internship on [The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI)](https://www.smhi.se/en/about-smhi) IT-department at the headquarters in Norrköping. The second goal of these projects are also supposed to serve as a set-up guide here on Github for anyone and everyone that wants to replicate what we have done. we will link every project to each other aswell._<br>

## 2. Goals and Objectives
This is part of a larger ongoing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) that will use Proxmox as a base. 
The goal of this project is to build a complete IT-environment and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying components and their part in a larger production chain.
<br>
<br>

## Method

### - Preparation
- We have our earlier projects as a foundation, [a Server running Proxmox](https://github.com/rafaelurrutiasilva/Proxmox_on_Nuc/tree/) and proxmox running [three replicated virtual machines from a Rocky Linux OS base](https://github.com/Filipanderssondev/Rocky_Linux_OS_Base_for_VMs) and [Ansible configuration on the management vm](https://github.com/JonatanHogild/Ansible_on_management_vm)
- We did our own separate processes at first, practicing on our local laptops with ansible an Podman for example

## 4. Target Audience
- This repo is for anyone who wants a step-by-step guide on .
This repo is also part of a larger project aimed at people interested in learning about IaC, and building such an environment from scratch.

## Document Status
> [!NOTE]  
> This is an ongoing work right now

## Disclaimer
> [!CAUTION]
> This is intended for learning, testing, and experimentation. The emphasis is not on security or creating an operational environment suitable for production.
